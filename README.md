# Weather-WebApp
I designed and implemented a Weather WebApp using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive application allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecasts for their desired locations.

The user interface of the Weather WebApp is clean, intuitive, and visually appealing. I utilized HTML for the structure and layout of the app, CSS for styling and design elements, and JavaScript for fetching weather data from a weather API and dynamically updating the content.
Upon opening the Weather WebApp, users are greeted with a search bar where they can enter the name of a city or a specific location. After submitting their search query, the application uses JavaScript to fetch real-time weather data from a weather API. The API response includes information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
